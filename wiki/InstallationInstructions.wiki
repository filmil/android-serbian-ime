#summary Instructions on how to install and use the Serbian Input Method.

= Introduction =
The application "Serbian Input Method (dev)" is an Android service that provides a soft onscreen keyboard for typing Serbian Cyrillic.

It is also for now my first foray into writing Android components.

= How to Install =

  # *Download the application from the Android Market.* You will need to do this via your handset. Find the application called Serbian Input Method (dev) on the market and install it as usual.
  # *Show some love to your friendly Android developers*.  Check their applications out on the Market. Be sure to check the many other fine applications that exist for the Serbian language (keyword: Serbian on the Android Market). There are at least two other Serbian input methods, and you should give them a spin too and see which one suits you best.
  # *Enable the alternate input method.* From the main screen, select Settings→Locale & Text →Serbian Input Method (dev) and put a check mark next to it.
  # *Use it when typing.* Do a long-press on any text field until a menu appears. Select the item *Input Method*, and then select *Serbian Input Method (dev)* from the menu that opens afterwards.
  # *Enjoy* your Serbian Cyrillic keyboard.
