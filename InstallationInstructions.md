# Introduction #
The application "Serbian Input Method (dev)" is an Android service that provides a soft onscreen keyboard for typing Serbian Cyrillic.

It is also for now my first foray into writing Android components.

# How to Install #
The input method application does not show in the application list when installed.  Instead, it provides a new Android "input method" (a new keyboard, if you will).  Follow the steps below to get activate this new input method.

  1. **Download the application from the Android Market.** You will need to do this via your handset. Find the application called Serbian Input Method (dev) on the market and install it as usual.
  1. **Show some love to your friendly Android developers**.  Check their applications out on the Market. Be sure to check the many other fine applications that exist for the Serbian language (keyword: Serbian on the Android Market). There are at least two other Serbian input methods, and you should give them a spin too and see which one suits you best.
  1. **Enable the alternate input method.** From the main screen, select Settings→Locale & Text →Serbian Input Method (dev) and put a check mark next to it.
  1. **Use it when typing.** Do a long-press on any text field until a menu appears. Select the item **Input Method**, and then select **Serbian Input Method (dev)** from the menu that opens afterwards.
  1. **Enjoy** your Serbian Cyrillic keyboard.
